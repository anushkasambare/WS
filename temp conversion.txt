1. Go to File -&gt; New Project. Select Java Web in categories and Web Application
in Projects. Click on Next to create web based project.

2. Enter a project name whatever you want and then click on Next. On next page
click Finish.

3. After completion of project creation process a window will appear like below.

4. Create web service.
Right click on Project -&gt; New -&gt; Web Service

5. Enter a Web Service Name and package name and then click on Finish to
create a Web Service.

6. As you can see in following pic; In Source Packages there is a package Service
which contains the service file temp_service.java. Open this file by double
click on it, So that we can add two operation that will convert temperature
from celcious to farhenheit and vice-versa.
Go to design mode by click on Design .

7. Click on Add Operation to add operation.

8. Give Operation name F_to_C and return type as Double. So this method will
return value in Double data type. After that click on Add button to give
parameters for method. Give its name as f and type as Double and then click
on OK button. Your one operation is now successfully created.

9. Repeat step 7 &amp; 8 to create second operation. But this time replace some
above entered data with following data.
F_to_C -&gt; C_to_F
f -&gt; c
10. Now go to source mode by click on Source and delete the selected segment
of code. Because it is default operation and we donâ€™t need this.

11. Now replace the selected area with following code to convert Fahrenheit to
Celsius.
Double c = (f-32)*1.8;
return c;

12. Now replace the selected area with following code to convert Celsius to
Fahrenheit and then press Ctrl+S to save.
Double f = (c*1.8)+32;
return f;

13. Now right click on project name and click on Deploy to deploy your project.

14. To test your web service follow the following process as in picture.

15. Following window will open in in browser. Now if you will enter a numeric
data into first box and you will click on first button it will convert the entered
data into Celsius.

16. Selected value is in celsius of 56.

17. Similarly second textbox and button will convert the numeric value into
Fahrenheit. Now to consume this web service we are creating a client.
18. Now create a new web application project with name as Temp_client.

19. Now open the index.html page of Temp_client and write the following
code into that.
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Temperature converter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-
scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;data&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Convert F to C&quot; name=&quot;ftoc&quot;
formaction=&quot;f_to_c.jsp&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Convert C to F&quot; name=&quot;ctof&quot;
formaction=&quot;c_to_f.jsp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

20. Now create two jsp pages for both submit button.
Right click on Web Pages -&gt; New -&gt; JSP

21. Enter file name f_to_c and then click on Finish.

22. Now repeat the step number 20 &amp; 21. But give the File Name as c_to_f.
23. Now you have created two jsp files.

24. Right click on Temp_client and select Web Service Client as below.

25. Click on Browse.

26. New window will appear and then select temp_service and click on OK.

27. Click on Finish.

28. Now open the c_to_f.jsp file and delete the selected line.

29. Now right click in between the body section and select Call Web Service
Operatin as below.

30. New window will appear select the C_to_F by expanding it and click on OK.
So that selected code in second pic will be automatically generated.

31. Now, make the selected area in step 30 as like selected area in below pic
by adding some line of code.

32. Now Open the f_to_c.jsp file and follow the steps from 28 to 31. Only the
change is in 30 number step and i.e. instead of C_to_F, you have to select
F_to_C.
33. Now run the Temp_client project. An window will be open like below.

34. Now you can to enter any numeric data into textbox and if you will click the
first button it will convert the numeric value into Celsius and vice-versa for
the second button.
