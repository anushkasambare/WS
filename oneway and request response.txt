 Now go into the Source mode of myws.java and add the selected statement to import everything from sql.



 Now replace the contents of getName method with following code.

try{
            Connection c=mydsn.getConnection();
            PreparedStatement ps=c.prepareStatement("select * from friends where id=?");
            ps.setInt(1, id);
            ResultSet r=ps.executeQuery();

            ps.setString(2, name);
            ps.executeUpdate();
           
            }catch(Exception e){}



 Now deploy the Service web application by right click on it.


 Now create another Web Application named ServiceClient to consume these two web services. Click on Next and then Finish.

 Adding a JSP page.
Right click on ServiceClient -> New -> Other

 In Categories select Web and in File Types select JSP. After that click on Next.

 Give name it as getData and then click on Finish.

 Follow the step number 44, 45 & 46 to create one more JSP page. But this time file name will be insertData.

  Now Open index.html page of ServiceClient by double click on it.



 Now replace the contents of BODY tag with following code in index.html file.

<form>
            <h2>One-way Operation</h2><br>
            <input type="text" name="txt1" placeholder="Enter ID"><br><br>
            <input type="text" name="txt2" placeholder="Enter Firstname"><br><br>
            <input type="submit" formaction="insertData.jsp" value="Insert Record"><br>

            <h1>--------------------------------------------</h1>

            <h2>Request-Response operation</h2><br>
            <input type="text" name="txt3" placeholder="Enter ID"><br><br>
            <input type="submit" formaction="getData.jsp" value="Get Firstname"><br><br>
        </form>


 Now right click on ServiceClient -> New -> Other.

 Select Web Services in Categories and Web Service Client in File Types. After that click on Next.

 Click on Browse button.

 Expand Service and select myws. After that click on OK.



 Enter Package as com.kk and click on Finish.






 Now open getData.jsp file by double click on it.



 Delete the selected part of BODY tag.



  Right click in between BODY tag and select Call Web Service Operation as in below screenshot.


 Select getName by expanding and then click on OK.


 Selected code between BODY tag will be automatically generated.


 Now add the following additional line and make it as below screenshot. After that press Ctrl+S to save the changes.
int fid = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("txt3"));

int id = fid;

out.println("Firstname = "+result);



  Now open the insertData.jsp file and follow the steps from 56 to 58. Only the change is in 58, you have to select insertName instead of getName.
Following selected code will be automatically generated.





 Insert the following codes and make it as in below screenshot. After that press Ctrl+S to save the changes.

int fid = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("txt1"));
String fname = request.getParameter("txt2");

int id = fid;
java.lang.String name = fname;


 Now Run the ServiceClient web application by right click on it.



 A window will open in browser like below.


 Now enter an ID in third textbox which you have inserted in your database table and click on Get Firstname button. It will give you the first name of particular entered ID.





 Now you can do One-way Operation also, by entering ID and Firstname and then click on Insert Record button. It will insert the data in table. But make sure you are not entering the ID which is already in created table.



 IA new page will appear. But this page will be blank. Because we are doing One-way Operation, consequently we will not get any response.


 Now you can check the table record to ensure that operation is successfully done.
As you can see that in step no 13 that, there was no record of DEVENDRA with ID in FRIENDS table. But in below FRIENDS table, record of DEVENDRA is showing.
